# Dynamic Nginx Server

Its not an Nginx Server.

Its just a server that dynamically maps a domain to an ip on your Nginx configuration or you can say it forwards a particular request to particular address using apis.

Contains apis to add and remove the domain-ip mapping.

Implement your own authentication and make sure to run it with a helper script to efficienty manage your user permissions.
